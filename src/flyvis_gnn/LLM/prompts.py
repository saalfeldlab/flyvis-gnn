Read the instructions and the base config, then create {state.n_parallel} diverse initial training
parameter variations. Each config already has a unique dataset name — do NOT change the
dataset field. Vary training parameters (e.g. lr_W, lr, coeff_g_phi_diff, coeff_W_L1, batch_size)
across the {state.n_parallel} slots to explore different starting points.

IMPORTANT: Training time target is {state.training_time_target_min} min per iteration — keep configurations within this budget.
IMPORTANT: Read user_input.md — if there are pending instructions, acknowledge them by appending to the "Acknowledged" section with timestamp and moving them out of "Pending Instructions".
